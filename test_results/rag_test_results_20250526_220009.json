While I can't confirm whether these specific recipes are explicitly keto or low-carb without seeing the diet tags, I can offer some guidance based on what's provided.\n\nFor **low-carb keto meals**, the **Keto Chicken Salad** seems like an excellent option because it provides detailed nutritional information that aligns with keto-friendly macros.
